            <p>people are distributed across the world unequally. There are regions where people live very close together; these are usually fertile regions along rivers and the coast with good living conditions. However, there are also regions where only few people live; for example, in cold areas such as Siberia. Not a lot of people live in deserts, jungles and mountainous areas either. The way in which the population is distributed over a region is called the population distribution.

            <p> Look at the US. The

             is the number of inhabitants divided by the surface of a country. In the US, it is 32 inhabitants per square kilometre. Note: it is an average number. The eastern half of the country has much more people per square kilometre; it is more densely populated than the western half. The population density there is low.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="feature-dsp"> 
            <p>The global population increases by 120 people every minute.
              This has two causes.

              The large number of births. Even though the number of children per family is decreasing, a lot of children are born especially in poor countries.

              On average people will get older and older. The 
              In 1950, life expectancy was only 48 years. The increased life expectancy means that people live longer, which also means that there are more people on Earth.

              Birth
              Families are often bigger in poor countries rich countries. There are four reasons for this:

              Children can do work for their parents; 

              People make less use of ways to prevent getting pregnant, this forbidden according to some religions.

              Many children die at a young age, which is why parents want a lot of children. This reduces their chance of becoming adults.

              You will be more respected if you have a lot of children.

              In rich countries, the families are smaller. This is because people know what to do if they do not want to have children.
              Moreover, raising children costs a lot of money. When you are old and are unable to work, there are benefits and pensions. You do not need children for that.
              The total global population is still growing steadily, but you can tell that the speed of the growth is decreasing. Because the number of births is decreasing in most countries.</p>

          <div class="feature-dsp"> 
            <p>Some people leave to another country to live there. This is called international migration. A lot of people migrate from Mexico to the United States. They hope to get wellpaid jobs and a better life. In Mexico they are called emigrants
. When they arrive in the US, the US will see them as immigrants. The image shows that the US is an important immigration country, 3 million people were added in five years’ time because of immigration. As a result, the population of the US increases. In the previous paragraphs, you have learned how the population grows as a result of births minus deaths. This is called the natural population growth. The growth because of migration is called social population growth. But people also constantly leave the US, to the Netherlands for example. These people need to be deducted from the total population. This way, there is a lot of calculation involved in determining a country’s population!

          <div class="feature-dsp"> 
            <p>  1. economical reasons. If someone does not have a job or has a job that pays poorly in their town, they need to look for work elsewhere. Such a person is called a labour migrant.
  2. political reasons. If there is a war somewhere or if someone is threatened because of having ‘wrong’ ideas, they might have to flee. This makes them a refugee.
  3. ecological reasons. When nature acts up, people are sometimes forced to migrate; for example due to long droughts, so they can’t harvest anything. You call them ecological refugees.
  4. social reasons. Sometimes the migrant goes alone. Once he has found a good place to stay, they want to have their family to come family reunification.
If a single person looks for a partner in his country of origin and takes him/her to the new country this is called 
            family formation.</p>

          <div class="feature-dsp"> 
            <p>The inhabitants of a country can be divided into age groups; this is called the age distribution. In order to see what the age distribution of a country is, you can use a population graph
            . This also states how many men and women there are. The Image shows the population graphs of Japan and Uganda. Such a graph is made up of layers per age group. You can see the ages on the left. The numbers are placed at the bottom: this shows how many people are part of each age group. The shape of the population graphs is different. Japan’s graph is small at the bottom. There are few children and a lot of elderly people.
            The families are small. Many rich countries have a population graph similar to that of Japan. The population graph for Uganda is much wider at the bottom. This means that there are many children and few elderly people. The families are big. This is not only true for Uganda, but for other poor countries as well.</p>

            <p>There are three global languages: English, Spanish and Arabic. These languages are spread out all over the world.
Five religions are spread out all over the world: Judaism, Christianity and Islam assume there is one god; Hinduism and Buddhism have multiple gods. The cultural diffusion
, the spread of cultural elements, started a long time ago and continues to this day (image). Important ways of cultural diffusion are trade and warfare. Western countries conquered regions everywhere which they then colonised.A colony is a country that is being controlled or belongs to another country. Indian cultures, such as the Incas in South America were conquered by Spain and Portugal. The original population was forced to become Catholic and had to learn their language. The new rulers brought African people to these regions as slaves. England controlled America, India, Australia and parts of Africa. Most colonies have since then become independent, but all sorts of cultural elements of the former rulers still play a major role

          <div class="feature-dsp"> 
            <p>Culture is the way in which a group of people live together. Culture is something which you are being taught by your parents. For example you learn to speak a language and are raised in the same way that your parents were raised. Culture makes you feel part of a group. Some things are normal to you and others are not, such as eating with cutlery, chopsticks or your right hand. Celebrating Eid al-Fitr or Christmas. Getting married or not. The main characteristics of a culture are called cultural elements. They are divided into three categories: Language and religion; things to do with you intellect. There are over 6,000 languages and probably as many religions. A large number of people have no religion. Laws, family ties and education; things to do with how you live together. In India, your parents choose your partner, there is no ‘dating’, but it is not forbidden by law. Clothes, food, buildings and art; the visible things in a country. Bikini or headscarf, pizza or sushi, the Eiffel Tower or the Taj Mahal, dance or ballad.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="feature-dsp"> 
            <p>A culture never stays the same forever. New words are constantly added in every language. There are traditional, religious people and more modern ones. Fashion and hypes come and go. Cultures also change because of cultural blending: elements from other cultures are used criss-cross and are adjusted. A pizza from the supermarket does not really look like the original pizza from Italy. Cultural elements blend in three ways: Mass media – films, TV, social media – enrich cultures. However, you are also exposed to a large amount of commercials unnoticed.  Migration brings cultural elements to other countries. Mexican immigrants in the south of the US speak ‘Spanglish’, every city in Europe has a mosque and Indian curry is the most popular dish in England. Tourists also influence the culture of the country they visit and vice versa. The culture that has most influence worldwide is the American culture. This is called  Americanisation
(image). T-shirts, hamburgers, Coca-Cola, English words, but also ideas are copied: standing up for yourself, making as much profit as possible and buying and throwing out more and more things.</p>

            In the Islamic world, the majority of the population has Islam as its religion. The people are Muslims. In everyday life, you can tell this by the headscarves of many women, praying five times per day and the call to pray from the mosque. People do not eat pork and do not drink alcohol. The Quran is the most important book of the religion.
        During Ramadan, they fast during the day for an entire month. In the Islamic world, people speak a variety of Arab dialects, except in Indonesia.

            Due to colonialism, Western European culture has spread to North America and Australia. There are multiple languages, but English is the primary one. In the western world, freedom of speech and equality are very important. Not everyone has a religion, but many people do have a Christian background. Science plays an important role and new things are quickly accepted. This means that society changes quickly and is prosperous.

            In this part of Africa, people are often part of a tribe. Each tribe has its own language and habits and often their own chief. There are usually multiple tribes within a country, because the borders have been drawn by the colonial rulers. Apart from their own language, many African people also speak French or English due to their colonial past. Important religions are Christianity and Islam, but there is also traditional African religion (source 13). In Sub-Saharan Africa there are a lot of poor people, but few are very wealthy.

            Due to their colonial past, nearly all countries have Spanish or Portuguese as their language and Catholicism as their religion. The original inhabitants of Latin America are poorest. The original culture is colourful, but disappears more and more. Along the east coast and in the Caribbean there are many descendants of people who were taken away from Africa as slaves. You will find many African cultural elements there, such as voodoo and the rhythm of the Samba dances.

There are also many different languages and different scripts. There are very rich countries and very poor ones.
